# Guess-the-Number
## ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game (Python)

## This is a simple Python game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.
## ðŸ”¹ How It Works:

- The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using random.randint().
- It prompts the user to guess the number.
- After each guess, the program provides feedback:
- If the guess is too low, it asks the user to try again.
- If the guess is too high, it suggests trying a lower number.
- When the correct number is guessed, it congratulates the player and displays the number of attempts taken.

## ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used:

- Python's built-in random module
- Basic concepts: loops (while), conditionals (if-elif-else), user input

## ðŸ”¹ Ideal For:

- Beginners learning loops, conditionals, and random number generation
- Mini-projects to improve coding logic and interactivity
